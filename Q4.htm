<!-- the Result will be 5 and uncaught refrence error also-->
<!-- the error generated due to bar variable-->
<!-- beacuse bar is local variable which can be accesed within the function 
not outside the function-->
<!-- and the ouput 5 is generated by baz variable -->
<!-- where baz is a global variable that can be called outside the variable that's why 
    output will be 5-->
	
<!-- solved-->
